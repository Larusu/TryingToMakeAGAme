# 🎮 Java 2d Game with Swing
This repository is a personal project where I'm learning game development by making a simple RPG 2D Game using Java Swing. It's all about having fun while understanding how game work, how Java handles graphics, and how to implement basic mechanics.  
Special thanks to [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow) for the amazing tutorial: **"How to Make a 2d Game in Java."** this project is heavily inspired by it!  

# 💻 Project Overview
This project serves as a way for me to:
- Get familiar with Java and Java Swing Syntax
- Understand basic game logic and how game loops work
- Learn how keyboard inputs, graphics, and animation come together

# ✅ Game features (for now)
- Start screen and game loop
- Player movement
- Keyboard input detection (WASD / arrowkeys)
- FPS control using Delta Time
- Custom-made pixel art 
- Understanding and applying how frame rate (FPS) works using Delta Time

# 📝 Code Notes 
This section contains **my personal notes and explanations** on syntax or what each line of code does.  
❗ Every line of code is commented to help explain what each part does -- feel free to read to read the 
files to deeply understand how the code works.❗  
  
  
  

⚠️ This project is still under construction, and I’ll continue updating it as I add more features or learn new things.
